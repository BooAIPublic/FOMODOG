# FOMODog: Your Ultimate FOMO Buster! :dog:

Does the fear of missing out (FOMO) on exciting events shared in a Telegram chat give you sleepless nights? Or make you compulsively check your phone every few minutes? Well, say goodbye to your FOMO because FOMODog is here to rescue you! 

This nifty project monitors your Telegram chat with a friend and barks (not literally, of course) when it spots any events/fun happenings being shared. No more missing out on spontaneous road trips because you were busy watching cat videos, or an impromptu Tacos cook-off while you were neck-deep in unnecessary office meetings! 

But hold on, the fun doesn't stop here! Our FOMODog doesn't just alert you about events. It goes the extra mile (like your favorite Retriever) to replace simple, unexciting URLs with lively descriptions using mind-boggling AI resources. By transforming boring https links into exciting text, it ensures your Telegram chat stays as lively and enticing as a wicked game of fetch! 

Plus, if you're the kind who loves the drama of sending "42" or "I have FOMO", our FOMODog brings you an added layer of interactivity and humor to keep your chat excitement level always at its peak!

So, if you're ready to kick FOMO to the curb and sprinkle some magic onto your otherwise mundane chats, clone this project, replace the placeholders with your keys, and watch the FOMODog at work! 

Happy eventful chatting, folks! :)
